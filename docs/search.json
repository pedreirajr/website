I hold a PhD in Transportation Engineering from the University of São Paulo (USP), where I studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel behavior through longitudinal tracking of individuals’ mobility choices over time. I’m also the deputy leader of the CETRAMA research group and have experience in consulting and technical cooperation with both the public and private sectors, helping bridge the gap between research and practice.\nMy research agenda covers topics such as travel behavior, urban accessibility, health-related mobility, humanitarian logistics, and transport resilience to climate hazards. I often approach these questions with a data-driven perspective, aiming to produce evidence that can support planning and operational decisions. Methodologically, I draw on classical Statistical Modeling, Machine Learning, Geostatistics, Network Science, Mathematical Optimization, and Simulation Modeling. I’m also engaged in Data Science education, with a focus on teaching applied statistics with R (by the way, I’m writing a book in Portuguese on the topic to provide a structured textbook for my classes in Brazil 👨🏻‍🏫).\nA commitment to open-source tooling and reproducible workflows is a central part of my work. I developed and maintain {cnefetools} (available on CRAN), an R package that supports access to Brazilian Census address data as well as land-use indices production, spatial aggregation, and interpolation of Census variables. I’m also developing {tripdistmodels}, which implements growth factor and gravity formulations for trip distribution modeling, and {susflows}, for generating hospital admission flows in Brazil’s public health system, the Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS."

Track inputs cover slope, curve radius, and adhesion coefficient, whereas locomotive inputs cover power, transmission efficiency, weight, frontal area, and axle count and wagon inputs cover fleet size, gross weight, axles, and frontal area. All calculations are fully reactive, updating in real time as parameters change. The main output is a tractive effort vs. resistance chart (plotted against speed) showing the adhesion-limited plateau, the power-limited hyperbolic decay, and their intersection with the resistance curve.

Users specify up to five materials — each with unit cost, gradation curve (six sieves), liquid limit, and plasticity index — and select a target specification band (curves A–F from the DNIT IPR-719 Pavement Manual) or define custom gradation limits. When a feasible solution exists, the app returns the optimal proportions, the resulting mixture cost in R$/m³, and a particle-size distribution chart of the blend overlaid on the specification envelope to confirm compliance.

G-SIVAR adapts the semivariogram concept from geostatistics into a scalar index of spatial dissimilarity, supports directional analysis to detect anisotropy, and applies to both quantitative and qualitative variables. The procedure fits a theoretical semivariogram to the empirical data across multiple directions, builds a null distribution via Monte Carlo randomization, and derives the G-SIVAR value and its significance from standardized semivariance. The method was validated on household car-trip data from the 2012 São Paulo Origin-Destination Survey, where it detected statistically significant spatial dependence and directional anisotropy (a nuance that Moran’s I cannot capture) and was published in the Bulletin of Geodetic Sciences journal in 2019.\nGitHub Paper"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The {cnefetools} R package is now available on CRAN. It provides an end-to-end workflow for accessing and analyzing address-level data from the 2022 Brazilian CNEFE (Cadastro Nacional de Endereços para Fins Estatísticos), released by IBGE. With read_cnefe(), you can download and read municipality-level CNEFE data as either an Arrow table for fast in-memory operations or as an sf spatial object ready for mapping and spatial analysis. The package also aggregates address counts by establishment and dwelling types to H3 hexagons or custom polygons via cnefe_counts(), and computes land-use mix indices with compute_lumi(). This includes conventional indices such as Entropy Index, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, and the Balance Index as well as the adapted Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and the Bidirectional Global-centered Balance Index proposed by Pedreira Jr et al. (2025).\nOne of the most powerful features is dasymetric interpolation through tracts_to_h3() and tracts_to_polygon(). These functions redistribute census tract variables (such as population and income) to other spatial units using CNEFE dwelling points as ancillary data, producing far more realistic estimates than simple areal weighting. This makes it straightforward to map socioeconomic indicators at the neighborhood or hexagonal grid level.\nUnder the hood, {cnefetools} leverages DuckDB with its spatial, H3, and zipfs extensions to perform spatial joins and aggregations efficiently, achieving speedups of up to 20x over pure-R code depending on the geospatialdata structure. A pure-R fallback is also available for users who prefer not to depend on DuckDB. To get started, simply run install.packages(\"cnefetools\"). You can find the source code on GitHub and explore detailed vignettes with worked examples on the package website."

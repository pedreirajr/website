    "text": "The {cnefetools} R package is now available on CRAN. It provides an end-to-end workflow for accessing and analyzing address-level data from the 2022 Brazilian CNEFE (Cadastro Nacional de Endereços para Fins Estatísticos), released by IBGE. With read_cnefe(), you can download and read municipality-level CNEFE data as either an Arrow table for fast in-memory operations or as an sf spatial object ready for mapping and spatial analysis. The package also aggregates address counts by establishment and dwelling types to H3 hexagons or custom polygons via cnefe_counts(), and computes land-use mix indices with compute_lumi(). This includes conventional indices such as Entropy Index, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, and the Balance Index as well as the adapted Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and the Bidirectional Global-centered Balance Index proposed by Pedreira Jr et al. (2025).\nOne of the most powerful features is dasymetric interpolation through tracts_to_h3() and tracts_to_polygon(). These functions redistribute census tract variables (such as population and income) to other spatial units using CNEFE dwelling points as ancillary data, producing far more realistic estimates than simple areal weighting. This makes it straightforward to map socioeconomic indicators at the neighborhood or hexagonal grid level.\nUnder the hood, {cnefetools} leverages DuckDB with its spatial, H3, and zipfs extensions to perform spatial joins and aggregations efficiently, achieving speedups of up to 20x over pure-R code depending on the geospatialdata structure. A pure-R fallback is also available for users who prefer not to depend on DuckDB. To get started, simply run install.packages(\"cnefetools\"). You can find the source code on GitHub and explore detailed vignettes with worked examples on the package website."

G-SIVAR adapts the semivariogram concept from geostatistics into a scalar index of spatial dissimilarity, supports directional analysis to detect anisotropy, and applies to both quantitative and qualitative variables. The procedure fits a theoretical semivariogram to the empirical data across multiple directions, builds a null distribution via Monte Carlo randomization, and derives the G-SIVAR value and its significance from standardized semivariance. The method was validated on household car-trip data from the 2012 São Paulo Origin-Destination Survey, where it detected statistically significant spatial dependence and directional anisotropy (a nuance that Moran’s I cannot capture) and was published in the Bulletin of Geodetic Sciences journal in 2019.\nGitHub Paper"

For that purpose, I usually draw on methods from Statistical Modeling, Machine Learning, Geostatistics, Network Science, Mathematical Optimization, and Simulation Modeling.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many spatial analyses require socioeconomic or demographic data at a geographic unit that does not match the one in which it was originally collected. This is a particularly common challenge in transportation planning, where the unit of analysis is the traffic zone, a spatial unit whose boundaries often do not coincide with those of census tracts.\nTraffic zone delineation follows design rules aimed at keeping intrazonal trips (trips that both start and end within the same zone) below a threshold — typically around 15% of all trips produced by that zone. This constraint, among others, often results in zone boundaries that do not coincide with census tract boundaries. As a result, analysts who need census-derived variables (population, income, racial composition, etc.) at the traffic zone level must transfer them from tracts to zones.\nThe most straightforward transfer method is areal interpolation: the value assigned to a target polygon is proportional to the share of each source tract’s area it contains (i.e., if a zone covers 30% of a tract’s area, it receives 30% of that tract’s total). The implicit assumption is that the variable of interest is uniformly distributed across the tract. In practice, however, population is rarely uniform — it concentrates along streets, in residential blocks, and away from parks, water bodies, or industrial areas. Applying areal weighting in such settings introduces systematic errors that grow with the mismatch between source and target geometries.\nDasymetric interpolation addresses this by incorporating auxiliary data that captures the spatial distribution of the variable within each source unit. For population-related variables, the natural choice is the location of private households: rather than spreading a tract’s population uniformly across its area, we distribute it equally among its registered dwellings and then aggregate by target polygon. This is precisely the data provided by the Brazilian CNEFE (Cadastro Nacional de Endereços para Fins Estatísticos), and it is what the tracts_to_polygon() function in {cnefetools} uses under the hood. The two-stage procedure for a count variable (e.g., number of residents in private permanent households) is illustrated below.\nFor average variables (e.g., average household head income), the procedure differs slightly: rather than dividing a tract’s total by the number of dwellings, each dwelling is simply assigned the tract’s average value directly. When aggregating to the target polygon, it receives the average of all assigned dwellings within it.\nIn a previous vignette I demonstrated this workflow for the municipality of São Paulo. Here I extend it to the entire São Paulo Metropolitan Region (RMSP), which spans 39 municipalities. Because each traffic zone belongs entirely to one municipality, we call tracts_to_polygon() once per municipality with its corresponding zones and bind the results at the end.1"

    "section": "Conclusions",
    "text": "Conclusions\nThe workflow presented here is straightforward but broadly applicable: any set of polygon boundaries can serve as the target geometry in tracts_to_polygon(), as long as a municipality code is available to anchor the CNEFE download. This makes dasymetric interpolation with {cnefetools} a general-purpose tool for transferring census variables to the spatial units that matter for each domain of analysis. Some practical examples:\n\nPublic health: the same approach can be used to estimate population counts and socioeconomic indicators for health districts (distritos sanitários) or catchment areas of primary care facilities, inputs that are essential for equity analyses and resource allocation;\nEducation: school districts or the coverage areas of regional education offices can be populated with school-age cohort data directly from the census.\nUrban planning: administrative subprefectures, special interest zones, or custom planning units can receive population and income estimates without resorting to areal weighting;\nEnvironmental studies: watersheds, protected areas, or flood-risk zones can be enriched with demographic data to assess exposure and vulnerability;\nSecurity and emergency management: police precincts or civil defense response zones can be characterized with population density and demographic composition.\n\nIn all these cases, the underlying logic is the same: census tracts are the source, CNEFE dwellings are the bridge, and the analyst’s polygon of interest is the target. The only requirement is that the target polygons respect municipal boundaries, a constraint that future versions of {cnefetools} aim to lift."

Hi! My name is Jorge Ubirajara and I'm an Assistant Professor at the Department of Transportation Engineering and Geodesy from the Federal University of Bahia ([UFBA](https://ufba.br/)), Brazil. I hold a PhD in Transportation Engineering from University of São Paulo ([USP](https://www.usp.br/)) and my research agenda covers topics such as travel behavior, urban accessibility, health-related mobility, humanitarian logistics, and transport resilience against climate hazards. I also develop open source tools in R to support reproducible research workflows. For more details, you can check my [background](about.qmd), browse my [publications](publications.qmd), or explore the [code and data](codeanddata.qmd) behind my projects.

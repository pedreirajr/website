## Jorge Ubirajara Pedreira Junior

I'm an Assistant Professor at the Federal University of Bahia ([UFBA](https://ufba.br/)) and hold a PhD in Transportation Engineering from University of São Paulo ([USP](https://www5.usp.br/)). My research sits at the intersection of Geospatial Analytics, Urban Data Science, and Applied Statistics, with applications in Transportation Planning and Policy. I also develop open source tools in R to support reproducible research workflows. Learn more about my [background](about.qmd), explore my [publications](publications.qmd), or check out the [code & data](codeanddata.qmd) behind my research.
